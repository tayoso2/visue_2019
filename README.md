# Visue POC

**Project Description**

Legacy Seams applied OFGEMâ€™s Common Network Asset Indices Methodology (CNAIM) to develop a model covering 12 asset classes for planning investment in electricity distribution infrastructure in Denmark for Evonet, N1, Trefor, Konstant. These were some of the companies in the supposed Visue merger at the time.

This also included development of a model which allows investment and risk to be balanced across multiple asset classes (CAO). The key output was a Qlik dashboard configured to present the asset data and planned investments within the context of CNAIM. 



**Status**

Visue POC was a pilot project demonstrating the use of EDA in a Community Decision Analytics context, using standard CNAIM models.  The project was delivered as part of a tender response with a view to an EDA licence sale.  However, there was a lack of support from sales; despite this we were initially announced as preferred bidder, but the withdrawal of Evonet and N1 from the tender to concentrate on their merger led the remnant of Visue members to engage with Copperleaf.  The EDA web environment from the original project has now been stood down.
